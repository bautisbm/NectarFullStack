# DESCRIPTION

Our application enables policy makers to view the correlations between Virgina school divisions that have Governer's STEM program versus those divisions that do not. Both sides will include information such as high school locations, their divisions, their test scores, and their post secondary acceptance rates to higher education institutions. Currently, the data we have is the basic division and school information taken from vdoe, with sol, cohort, and post secondary achievement/enrollment tables filled with information from 2014 as a start. We also include a csv file imported from VLDS on CTE data for the year 2014.
